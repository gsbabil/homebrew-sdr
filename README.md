## homebrew-sdr

Homebrew formulas for software defined radio.

### How do I install these formulas?

Just `brew tap gsbabil/homebrew-sdr` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you
can `brew install gsbabil/homebrew-sdr/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsbabil/homebrew-sdr/master/<formula>.rb
```

Many of these formulas depend on GNU Radio from
[metacollin/homebrew-gnuradio](https://github.com/metacollin/homebrew-gnuradio).
